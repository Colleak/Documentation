## Project:
### Where-is-my-colleague Tracker (2023)

**Objective:**
The "Where-is-my-colleague Tracker" project aims to develop a convenient app that allows IO Eindhoven employees to quickly see the whereabouts of their colleagues for more efficient collaboration.

**Data Sources:**
- Exchange API / Office 365 API for calendar information.
- WiFi information (with permission) to track mobile devices on the network.
- Manually entered information via the app (e.g., "I am on floor 4").

**App Features:**
- Favorites list of frequently collaborated colleagues.
- Quick search for employees at a specific location by name.
- "Notify when not in a meeting" function to signal availability.
- Simple location updates for employees.
- "I'm looking for you" option, possibly linkable to apps like WhatsApp or Teams.

**Technologies:**
- Development in services (containerized) on AWS or Azure.
- Front-end can be a hybrid app (e.g., React Native), web app, native app, or smartwatch app.

**Learning Objectives:**
This project provides opportunities to learn about API integration, UI development, microservices, and building user-friendly apps. Secure access to data sources is ensured.
